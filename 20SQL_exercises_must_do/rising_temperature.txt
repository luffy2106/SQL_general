```
My solution:
```
WITH history AS
(
SELECT *,
LAG(temperature, 1, 0) OVER (ORDER BY recordDate) AS prev_temperature,
LAG(recordDate, 1, 0) OVER (ORDER BY recordDate) AS prev_date
FROM Weather
ORDER BY recordDate
)

SELECT p1.id as id
FROM history p1, history p2
WHERE p1.id = p2.id 
      and p1.temperature > p2.prev_temperature 
      and DATEDIFF(p1.recordDate, p2.prev_date ) = 1;
```
Solution given by platform:
```
SELECT w1.id
FROM Weather AS w1 , Weather AS w2
WHERE w1.Temperature > w2.Temperature AND DATEDIFF(w1.recordDate , w2.recordDate) = 1
```
