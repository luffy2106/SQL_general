### What is the difference between Inner Join and Left Join ?

The main difference between Inner Join and Left Join lies in the result set they produce when combining two tables.
- Inner Join: An Inner Join returns only the matching rows from both tables. It selects the records that have matching values in both tables based on the specified join condition.
- Left Join: A Left Join returns all the rows from the left (or first) table and the matching rows from the right (or second) table. If there are no matching rows in the right table, it still includes the rows from the left table but with NULL values for the columns of the right table
